synopsis:            Utility Functions For Parallel Haskell
description:
  Parallel Haskell suffers from the problem, that the sequential part races
  with the evaluation of the sparks. This results often in \"fizzled\" sparks
  and reduced parallelity.
  .
  This package provides utility functions adding \"barrier\" annotations. They
  basically state, that the spark pool should be flushed, before the
  computation continues.
